# EcoSort  
**Intelligent Waste Classification for Enhanced Recycling**  

EcoSort is an AI-powered waste classification system that helps users efficiently sort waste into six categories: **Cardboard, Compost, Glass, Metal, Paper, and Plastic**. It leverages deep learning models like **VGG16** for accurate waste identification and integrates with a **Streamlit-based web app** for real-time classification via image upload or webcam.  

## Features  
- AI-powered waste classification using **VGG16 & ResNet50**  
- Real-time image classification via webcam or image upload  
- Fine-tuned deep learning model for high accuracy  
- Provides actionable recycling suggestions to promote sustainable waste management  

## Tech Stack  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV  
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit  
- **Programming Language**: Python
